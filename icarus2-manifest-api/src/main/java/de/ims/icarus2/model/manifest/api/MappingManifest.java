		 * If the target elements are spans, than an efficient

		 * for each such chunk the first and last element in the target layer that is truly contained
		 * in this chunk (with respect to its begin- and end-offset). To lookup a target the algorithm
		 * then first determines the correct chunk according to the source elements index and then
		 * performs a binary search on the spans in that chunk to find the target element.
		 * Performance can be controlled by adjusting chunk size to a value that provides a good tradeoff
		 * between required memory space to store the index information and the speed incurred by the
		 * binary search (which serves as a constant cost factor in the performance formula).

		 * be assigned many different categories at once.
		 *
		 * Depending on the container type of the target elements, this version gets easy or very expensive.
		 *
		 * If the target elements are spans, than it is possible to use the strategy proposed for the
		 * {@link #MANY_TO_ONE} relation with a slight addition: When the first target container is found
		 * using binary search within the chunk, then neighbors to both sides are added to the result collection,
		 * until containers are encountered for both ends, that do not contain the source element. The complexity
		 * in this case is limited by the maximum "nesting depth" of spans in the target layer, which remains
		 * to be evaluated as a proper upper bound. Looking in the neighborhood of the first successful match
		 * is possible due to the sorted nature of top-level layer elements and the sorting rules for spans
		 * (span locality).

		 * For non-monotonic target elements the rules for the {@link #ONE_TO_MANY} relation apply.
