
	-	Semantic Search interface/implementation to use information from DS to have "semantic cluster" or "semantic closeness" constraints as a form of fuzzy search
	-	Serialization for corpus edits to automatically keep track of changes on a rather high level compared to tracking physical changes via git or other systems
		-	what level of integration? view/driver/etc ?
		-	what form? xml, json, sql?
		-	one-way serialization or ability of recreating edit/change object instances from serialized form? <- tricky!
		
	-	Implement "shared" annotation layers that use a common mapping from Items to a binary payload.
		-	Have individual annotation types maintain a Pointer+Offset into the binary payload and (de)construct values when reading/writing
		-	For values of variable binary length use a dictionary or compression lookup to map them into a discrete numerical space
		-	Especially useful for "static" formats, e.g. CoNLL etc...
