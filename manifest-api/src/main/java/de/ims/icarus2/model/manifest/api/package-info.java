/**
 * Defines all the high level members of the ICARUS2 manifest framework.
 * <p>
 * Manifests are descriptive objects that define the composition of a "real"
 * corpus or its individual parts. Their purpose is to decouple representation
 * (read as implementation) of corpus elements from their respective linguistic
 * semantics.
 * This way it is for example possible to model all types of tree like structures
 * ever to occur in corpora with the exact same collection of data structures, while
 * carrying information about their individual meaning (dependency syntax tree,
 * discourse tree, etc...) in the accompanying manifest objects.
 * <p>
 * Manifests can be defined directly by instantiating the desired java implementations
 * or externally via XML, JSON or other supported serialization formats.
 * The {@code de.ims.icarus2.model.manifest.xml} package defines a default XML
 * serialization scheme for all members of the manifest framework.
 * <p>
 * Since manifests in general support templating and therefore inheritance, there are a
 * few important guidelines to consider when implementing their interfaces or even
 * when using them programmatically:
 *
 * Whenever a manifest defines an <i>internal iterator</i> method that takes a {@link java.util.function.Consumer}
 * instance, like {@link de.ims.icarus2.model.manifest.api.OptionsManifest#forEachOption(java.util.function.Consumer)},
 * it should obey the following rule: To ensure consistency in the case of templating the implementation should first
 * forward the iteration to its template, if defined, and only then perform the iteration on locally declared data.
 *
 * Usually a manifest interface that can be subject to templating defines a derivation of each such iterator method
 * with a restriction to only access local data
 * (e.g. {@link de.ims.icarus2.model.manifest.api.OptionsManifest#forEachLocalOption(java.util.function.Consumer)} for
 * the method mentioned initially).
