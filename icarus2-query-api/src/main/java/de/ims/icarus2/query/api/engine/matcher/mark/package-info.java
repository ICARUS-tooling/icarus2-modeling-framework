/**
 * Provides marker expressions for horizontal and vertical restriction of a target node's position.
 * <p>
 * Note that the classes in this package also translate from IQL value space, which uses {@code 1}
 * as first index to the range semantics of the actual matcher implementations, which all work
 * 0-based.
